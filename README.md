My attempt at Advent of Code 2023, using c++

I have not tried to optimize the codes, but rather focus on the learning and perfection of my understanding of c++. Advent of code provides a good opportunity to solve unique problems and learn about string parsing, data conversions, some simple algorithms and data structures.

I am also using github actions to ensure all of my pushes do actually compile. Just a simple CI addition :D 

The compiler I have used is g++, in order to run the code, navigate to the respective day and 
```g++ part1.cpp -o part1.o```

And in order to run the code, 

```./part1.o <input.txt```
